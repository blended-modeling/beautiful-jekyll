##  Blended Modelling for Software Architectures

In tutorial @ICSA 2023, we demonstrated two major activities in modelling and designing software architectures:

* Given a domain-specific language at hand, we will show how to architect a blended modelling environment for it. From that, we will show how to leverage our framework to semi-automatically generate the blended modelling environment in the tool ecosystem (Eclipse Modeling Framework).

* Once the blended modelling environment is generated, we will show how to architect software systems by using the generated blended modelling environment, demonstrating its seamless synchronization capabilities across different modelling notations and collaborative editing features.
