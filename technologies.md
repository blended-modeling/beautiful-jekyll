# BUMBLE Technologies
The BUMBLE technologies provide reference solutions for the generation and management of blended modeling environments from DSMLs. These technologies will help support the development of heterogeneous systems by enabling seamless textual and graphical collaborative modeling. The technologies developed during BUMBLE project are available in open source and are maintained at the <a href="https://github.com/blended-modeling">Blended Modeling GitHub site</a>.

The following repositories are currently accessible:

## Blended modeling

* [UML-RT_StateMachines_Transformations](https://github.com/blended-modeling/UML-RT_StateMachines_Transformations) Transformations for UML-RT state machines using Epsilon Transformation Language (ETL).
* [PSS](https://github.com/blended-modeling/PSS) PSS Blended Modeling.
* [keptn-consistency-maintenance](https://github.com/blended-modeling/keptn-consistency-maintenance) Towards Continuous Consistency Checking of DevOps Artefacts.
