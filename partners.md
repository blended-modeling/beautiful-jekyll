**Unibap AB** -- Supplier

Unibap is a supplier of safety-critical vision processing solutions currently considering intelligent visual perception solutions. Competitors to Unibap’s space products are primarily in-house built computers by satellite integrators, intelligent automation and quality assurance as combinations of subsystem providers and integrators. Sensor product competitors are companies like Hexagon, Cognex, Roboception, Stemmer Imaging, while programming free software interface competitors are companies like RoboMaster.

Blended modeling is for Unibap a way to improve their own engineering processes and the tools/services they provide to third parties, and thereby give them an edge on their competition. The results of BUMBLE will be exploited in a two-fold manner: (i) they will be integrated in the current solutions Unibap provides to their customer for developing software for Unibap's hardware products, and (ii) they will improve the development process at Unibap regarding software/hardware co-programming. Additionally, with BUMBLE, Unibap will have a unique opportunity to collaborate with industrial actors which already apply the MDE paradigm successfully.


**Volvo Technology AB** -- OEM in automotive domain

The Volvo Group is one of the world's leading manufacturers of trucks, buses and construction equipment, drive systems for marine and industrial applications, and services.

BUMBLE will provide results that will make development of in particular embedded vehicle systems more efficient and give Volvo an edge on its competitors. As complex engineering information is produced, used and maintained, multiple editing capabilities is a crucial feature. By using the appropriate notation for each task, engineers will be able to work with efficiency, correctness and creativity with the corresponding positive effects on products and services.


**Mälardalen University** -- University

MDH has a strong focus on MDE for complex software-intensive systems. More specifically, MDH is internationally recognized to have provided several novel solutions in the MDE field, e.g., for the transition between EMF-based graphical modeling artifacts to textual code artifacts and back in industrial contexts.

Since most of the research carried out at MDH is based on collaborative initiatives with industry, new collaborations with European companies established in BUMBLE represents a direct advantage for drawing up future research initiatives. The expertise gained through BUMBLE and the open-source results will give MDH even more international visibility, thus potentially improving the chances for future research funding both nationally and internationally.

	
**Saab AB** -- OEM in surveillance domain

During the last decades mission and safety critical systems are increasingly reliant upon software. The rate of functional change has also increased dramatically in the industry. More and more customers expect ready-to-use off-the-shelf products. This induces a significant turnaround in the development process for projects conducted by this industry. In this context, the ability to quickly react on changing requirements to provide customer adapted solutions which seamlessly integrate in the customers’ landscape is crucial for success. Saab is using a variety of domain models, where the integration of blended models will enhance productivity, and make the handover between engineering disciplines seamless.
	
**HCL Technologies** -- Tool and service provider

HCL Technologies is a global services company with >175000 employees. HCL Software is a division of  HCL Technologies. HCL RTist is part of HCL Software that develop, market, sell, and support over 20 product families in the areas of Customer Experience, Digital Solutions, Secure DevOps, Security & Automation.
HCL RTist is an Eclipse-based modeling and development environment for creating event-driven real-time applications. It supports the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and its real-time profile (UML-RT).

Systems engineers use RTist for specifying and documenting the structure and behavior of complex application architectures using UML diagrams of various kinds.
Software engineers use RTist for developing application code which to a large extent can be automatically generated from the UML model. Highly efficient C and C++ code can be generated, which together with a run-time library can be built into executable applications.

HCL is participating in BUMBLE to investigate how blended modeling, especially textual state machines, can improve the user experience, make users more effective and simplify compare and merge operations as well as refactoring of models.
The aim is to attract a new generation developers to create real-time applications by model-driven development in HCL RTist
Primary focus is to extend the current Eclipse-based product, but also looking at other IDEs (VS Code, Theia, …) for potential next product generation

From Pictor’s perspective the results achieved with BUMBLE represent a competitive advantage by enabling tool sets that will have a major impact to both shorten the development time and improving product quality. Blended modeling is for Pictor Consulting a way to improve their own engineering processes.

Working on BUMBLE technology allows Pictor, as a partner, the ability to shape it to match its professional and industry needs overall. The progress envisioned for blended modeling will provide not only extended profits when comparing to traditional technology, but also increase product quality according to the planned expectations. 

Pictor takes over the project coordinating role after Alten and is excited to work with different industry partners and universities that share its passion towards creating value and innovation in the model-driven development of complex systems.

**Canon Production Printing Netherlands B.V.** -- OEM in professional digital printing domain

Canon Production Printing develops high-end inkjet-based printers in three categories: 1) industry-leading continuous-feed printers for massive print volumes and fast, high-quality results in full color or black & white; 2) highly efficient, high-volume printers for in-house printing or publishing; 3) large format printers for stunning display graphics and high-quality CAD/GIS applications. Canon Production Printing also provides workflow solutions for print service providers based on the PRISMA portfolio. The large variability in printers considerably impacts product development in all disciplines and servicing the install-base. By applying BUMBLE results to couple models of the same and different engineering disciplines and providing collaborative blended modeling facilities in the context of variability management, Océ expects to improve development efficiency by 15% and service efficiency by 10% within 5 years from the start of BUMBLE.

**Modeling Value Group** -- Tool and service provider

MVG is an innovative tool and service provider with a special focus on DSMLs developed using both Eclipse- and MPS-based technologies. MVG has extensive experience on MDSE projects and expertise on declarative modeling and transformation languages and standards. MVG develops DSMLs for customers for insurance, document-exchange and rule-intensive (government) organisations. These DSMLs have both textual and diagrammatical syntaxes. The MVG uses both EMF related tools as well as MPS. 

The results of the BUMBLE project will help MVG to provide better integrated MDSE solutions to their customers. The competitive advantage brought by BUMBLE will come from the extension of the declarative modeling languages and rule engines produced by MVG so to support blended modeling. Also, it is expected that the results of the BUMBLE project will lead to a more widespread usage of MDSE technologies in larger commercial and governmental organizations, thus helping MVG in further enlarging their market share. As an example, the Dutch tax-office is already willing to employ blended modeling technologies, specifically for building incremental transformations between many textual syntaxes and a shared runtime model.
