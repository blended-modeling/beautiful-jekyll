---

We carry out research in software engineering and software architecture in general, and specifically on their socio-technical and environmental sustainability. Software and sustainability play a key role in modern society. Europe focuses on sustainability and innovation more than ever. Our focus is on devising systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches for designing, developing, and maintaining complex software intensive systems.

## Focus
Our **focus** is on the following scientific areas of interest:

  Our philosophy is that research should be industrial-relevant and serve the final purpose of being applied in practice. To this end, we specifically focus on the “real’’ needs of industrial practice by establishing collaboration with our industrial partners. In long term, the results of our research contribute to the European agenda by providing sustainable and innovative approaches to support service societies.
